# naturegraphics

My first freelance web development project for a graphic design business. The user can upload or delete photos in different galleries to display their most recent work, and it contains a Contact Us page that allows site visitors to contact the owner via email by taking advantage of the SendGrid API. All photos in the carousels are stored in an AWS S3 bucket and the site runs on a Heroku dyno. I am currently working on improving the SEO and accessibility of this site and have added Meta tags and implemented a way for the owner to add custom Alt tags to photos throught the Django Admin page. Having a client using this site in the real world has been a great opportunity to discover different bugs and communicate with the owner to implement new features or style changes.
